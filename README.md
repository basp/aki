This is a LambdaMOO port written in Go. Main goals are to learn more both about the LambdaMOO implementation itself and at the same time to improve Go coding skills. Of course, ending up with something useful would be nice too.

Currently it's still mostly infrastructure and a few bits and pieces as instruction set for the VM is slowly completed. It currently has no real end user interface but it does has a few of the key operations implemented.

This is most definately not compatible or faithful to the original LambdaMOO implementation by Pavel Curtis but it _is_ heavily inspired by it.

Check `main.go` for a simple program that shows some of the VM.

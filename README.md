This is a port of LambdaMOO to Go. It can't do much but at least it can `ADD`, `FORK` and `SUSPEND` (`SUSPEND` is not a built-in function but a VM operation with the same interface). 

This is most definately not compatible or faithful to the original LambdaMOO implementation by Pavel Curtis but it _is_ heavily inspired by it.
